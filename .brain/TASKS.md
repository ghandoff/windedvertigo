# Tasks

## Nordic — Governance Persistence + Multi-region (2026-06-13) — feat/governance-persistence-and-multiregion

Branch cut from `feat/budget-c-and-gates-preview`. Inherits all governance persistence wiring from that branch.

### GAP 1 — Persist governance layer to Supabase
- [x] **`supabase/migrations/20260613000001_018_pcs_review_gate.sql`** — Three tables: `pcs_review_events` (append-only with Postgres rules), `pcs_governance_config` (singleton), `pcs_governance_rules` (seeded with 2 defaults).
- [x] **`src/lib/pcs-review-events.js`** — Persistence layer: `appendReviewEvent()`, `getReviewEvents()`, `getRecordGateStatus()`, `getGovernanceConfig()`, `updateGovernanceConfig()`, `getGovernanceRules()`, `upsertGovernanceRule()`.
- [x] **`POST /api/pcs/review`** — wired to call `appendReviewEvent()` (non-fatal on failure).
- [x] **`deriveGateStatus(events[])`** — pure function added to `review-gate.js`; replaces inline derivation in `pcs-review-events.js`.
- [x] **verify:review-gate** — extended with 9 new `deriveGateStatus` tests (106 total, 0 failed).

### GAP 2 — Surface ReviewStatusBadge on detail pages
- [x] **`src/components/ReviewStatusBadge.js`** — shared badge component (created on `feat/budget-c-and-gates-preview`).
- [x] **`GET /api/pcs/review/status`** — endpoint for single-record gate status.
- [x] **Evidence detail** (`/research/pcs/evidence/[id]/page.js`) — badge wired.
- [x] **Claim detail** (`/research/pcs/claims/[id]/page.js`) — badge wired.
- [x] **Canonical-claim detail** (`/research/pcs/canonical-claims/[id]/page.js`) — badge wired.

### NEW — Multi-region / multi-authority dimension
- [x] **`CLAIM_AUTHORITY_REGIONS`** — constant exported from `pcs-config.js` (FDA, EFSA, Health Canada, TGA, FSANZ, Japan MHLW).
- [x] **`supabase/migrations/20260613000002_019_claim_authority_regions.sql`** — `authority_regions TEXT[]` column + GIN index on `pcs_claims`.
- [x] **`src/lib/pcs-claims.js`** — `parsePostgresRow` and `parsePage` updated to map `authorityRegions`.
- [x] **`src/lib/pcs-explorer.js`** — `filterByRegion(rows, region)` exported; all 3 query functions accept `{ region }` option.
- [x] **`GET /api/pcs/explore`** — accepts `region` query param, returns `region` in response.
- [x] **`/research/pcs/explore`** — region/authority selector added; Authorities column added to ExplorerTable; re-queries on region change.
- [x] **`tests/pcs-explorer.verify.mjs`** — new file, 23 tests: `filterByRegion` edge cases + `CLAIM_AUTHORITY_REGIONS` contract. Added to `verify:all`.
- [ ] **Data backfill**: `authority_regions` data is empty (schema only). Research team to populate via manual review. Flagged in handoff.

### Pending
- [ ] **Push to Garrett for review**: feature branch `feat/governance-persistence-and-multiregion`. **Do NOT push to main**.
- [ ] **Supabase migrations**: run `20260613000001_018_pcs_review_gate.sql` and `20260613000002_019_claim_authority_regions.sql` on the live DB after Garrett reviews.

## Nordic — Parts B + C: Expert Gates & Governance (2026-06-13) — feat/budget-c-and-gates-preview

- [x] **`src/lib/review-gate.js`** — reusable expert-in-the-loop gate library (pure logic, no I/O). Exports: `GATE_MODES` (4 modes), `GATE_STATUS`, `AUDIT_ACTION`, `createAuditEvent()` (frozen/immutable), `validateStatusTransition()`, `applyRule()` / `checkRuleViolations()`, `isRubberStamp()`, `computeCorrectionRate()`, `computeTimeSaved()` (explicit baselines, always `isEstimate: true`), `computeRuleAdherence()`.
- [x] **DEFAULT_GATE_MODE** = `human-first-ai-verify` (Sharon's preference: human reads + enters, AI verifies alignment after).
- [x] **3 new capabilities** in `capabilities.js`: `pcs.review:approve` (researcher/ra/admin/super-user), `pcs.review.rules:edit` (ra/admin/super-user), `pcs.governance:manage` (super-user-only in `SUPER_USER_ONLY_CAPABILITIES` → live re-verify).
- [x] **`POST /api/pcs/review`** — submit review actions (approve/correct/reject/request-changes) with role gate.
- [x] **`GET /api/pcs/review/queue`** — unified review queue, filterable by type and confidence.
- [x] **`GET|POST /api/pcs/governance`** — governance toggle (super-user only). Ships OFF by default.
- [x] **`GET|POST /api/pcs/governance/rules`** — admin/RA define which gate mode applies per record type.
- [x] **`GET /api/pcs/governance/metrics`** — correction rate, time-saved estimate, rule adherence.
- [x] **`/research/pcs/governance`** — management dashboard for Sharon: toggle, metrics, rules, time-saved assumptions.
- [x] **`/research/pcs/review-queue`** — unified review queue UI with status badges.
- [x] **`ReviewStatusBadge`** exported from review-queue page for platform-wide use.
- [x] **Sidebar** — "Review Governance ✦" group added to super-user layout only.
- [x] **verify:review-gate** — 97 tests: all acceptance criteria from spec §7. `verify:all` green (355 total).
- [ ] **Pending Garrett review**: push feature branch `feat/budget-c-and-gates-preview` to GitHub. **Do NOT push to main**.
- [ ] **After Garrett demo to leadership**: flip governance toggle ON via `/research/pcs/governance`.
- [ ] **Persistence**: connect governance config + rules + audit log to Supabase (in-memory stubs currently reset on cold start).
- [ ] **Status badges**: add `ReviewStatusBadge` to claim detail, evidence detail, and canonical claim pages.

## Nordic — Budget C Preview (2026-06-13) — feat/budget-c-market-explorer-preview

- [x] **Budget C Marketing Intelligence Interface** (`/research/pcs/explore`) — super-user-gated, three lenses (by benefit category, by ingredient, by product). Results table: Claim · Ingredient/Dose · Benefit Category · Evidence (# studies) · Substantiation Status · PCS Reference.
- [x] **Substantiation Status** — transparent Supported/Thin/Unsupported derived from evidence count + SQR-RCT normalized scores (0–1). Thresholds in `SUBSTANTIATION_THRESHOLDS` config constant. Hover badge shows inputs.
- [x] **Substantiation Dossier export** — DOCX (uses existing `docx` library). Human sign-off field: omit → DRAFT watermark on every page. Provide name → final export attributed to named reviewer.
- [x] **Capabilities** — `pcs.market-explorer:view` + `pcs.dossier:export` added to `CAPABILITIES` + `SUPER_USER_ONLY_CAPABILITIES`. Live Notion re-verify on every API call (same gate as `pcs.revisions:revert`).
- [x] **Sidebar** — "Marketing Intelligence ✦" group added to super-user sidebar layout only. All other roles see nothing.
- [x] **verify:market-explorer** — 31 tests: capability registration, role gating (all 4 non-super roles blocked), threshold shape, normalizeSqrScore correctness, computeSubstantiationStatus all three outcomes.
- [ ] **Pending Garrett review**: push feature branch to GitHub once reviewed. Branch: `feat/budget-c-market-explorer-preview`. **Do NOT push to main** — push auto-deploys to `nordic.windedvertigo.com`.
- [ ] **Optional**: add Sharon to `PREVIEW_ALLOW_LIST` (single constant in `pcs-explorer.js`) when ready to let her demo herself vs. Garrett driving the demo.
- [ ] **Budget C payment** → widen role access beyond super-user.

## Whirlpool actions — 2026-05-20

From the may 20 whirlpool ([notion AI meeting](https://www.notion.so/366e4ee74ba48035836fca89b21386d6) · [agenda](https://www.notion.so/366e4ee74ba481f79453eb7516cd3872)).

## Whirlpool actions — 2026-05-13

From the may 13 whirlpool meeting recording ([Notes by Gemini](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlFszMKFsNQLXi365rfRj5lA6rtb-NPjvJmu173Z1sY/edit) · [Transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlFszMKFsNQLXi365rfRj5lA6rtb-NPjvJmu173Z1sY/edit?tab=t.anee4cn9bvig) · [agenda](https://www.notion.so/35fe4ee74ba4818483c5c797e791790a)). The session shifted from the substack/harbour/Play@TED agenda into a focused website working session.

- [ ] **garrett** — fix Website Load: resolve the "Do" page loading issue on windedvertigo.com
- [ ] **the group** — catalog assets: pull existing assets Maria created for PRIME over the years; make tangible, accessible, and ready for showcasing

- [ ] **jamie** — hand off content: hand off think pieces and relevant assets to Payton for social campaigns / posting
- [ ] **garrett** — implement hyperlinks: add "dive deeper" buttons/hyperlinks on the "What" page for key concepts (low-stakes environment, design process) → link to longer philosophical thinkpieces

## Whirlpool actions — 2026-05-06

From the may 6 whirlpool meeting recording ([notion AI meeting](https://www.notion.so/358e4ee74ba480d7a270f44aa2dad4bd) · [agenda](https://www.notion.so/356e4ee74ba481f6bfa6e5487e1721d4)).

- [ ] **Jamie** — finalize "Learning to Fly" Substack piece by Friday (preferred) or Monday at latest, hand off to Payton

## Completed 2026-05-05 — Nordic Research Platform: PCS evidence Wave 7.0.5

Full debrief in `.brain/handoff.md`. App: `apps/nordic-sqr-rct`. Branch: `ghandoff/windedvertigo`. Deploys to `nordic.windedvertigo.com` (Vercel).

- [x] **Research-team article search tool at `/pcs/evidence`** (`ff7f591`) — DOI / PMID / title → PubMed + Semantic Scholar hits → 7-tier PDF retrieval waterfall (`src/lib/pmc.js`) → Vercel Blob `evidence-pdfs/`. Endpoint: `POST /api/pcs/evidence/save-from-search`.
- [x] **PubMed MeSH auto-classify into EVIDENCE_TYPES** (`eb7ebf5`) — RCT / Meta-analysis / Systematic review / Observational / Review. No more "everything is RCT" defaulting.
- [x] **In-library detection** (`3a8ace2`) — search hits cross-check existing rows by DOI/PMID; saved rows show "✓ In library / Open existing row →"; saved chip is clickable Link to detail page.
- [x] **Manual PDF upload for paywalled / EndNote-only rows** (`c548317`) — `POST /api/pcs/evidence/[id]/pdf-upload` multipart route + UI button + drag-and-drop on evidence detail page.
- [x] **Hard-merge dedup** (Wave 7.0.5 T8.1, in flight at handoff write) — `createEvidence` returns existing rows on DOI/PMID match instead of duplicating; surfaces `merged` flag.
- [x] **Phase 1 perf** (`e7bf068`) — `revalidate` + `s-maxage` cache headers on five `/api/pcs/*` GET routes; `revalidatePath()` on POST/PATCH; `loading.js` skeletons for four pages. Edge-cache HIT serves `/api/pcs/evidence` in 33ms (was 500–1500ms cold).
- [x] **Default-sort improvements** (`594f8b1`) — `PcsTable` accepts `defaultSortKey` + `defaultSortDir`; evidence page sorts `lastEditedTime DESC`; newly-added rows default to top + jump-to-row from save. localStorage key bumped to `pcs-sort-v2-`.
- [x] **One-shot test-pollution dedup** (`bb0e8c5`) — archived 3 rows. Script: `apps/nordic-sqr-rct/scripts/archive-test-evidence-rows.mjs`.
- [x] **Salvage from archived working tree** (`1854467`) — 4 unique docs migrated from standalone `~/Projects/nordic-sqr-rct/` to monorepo. Standalone renamed to `~/Projects/nordic-sqr-rct.archived-2026-05-05/`.

### Pending — Nordic platform follow-ups

- [ ] **Set `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` + `CORE_API_KEY` on Vercel prod env** — without them the article-search waterfall returns 429 on those two tiers (effective coverage 5/7). Highest-leverage env-var task on the platform right now.
- [ ] **Verify T8.1 hard-merge after it lands** — confirm `merged: true` returns when DOI/PMID matches an existing row, and that the existing-row return path still runs the EVIDENCE_TYPES classifier (regression risk).
- [ ] **UX sweep follow-ups** — placeholder until `apps/nordic-sqr-rct/.brain/ux-sweep-2026-05-05.md` lands from the parallel agent. After it lands: read top items, surface here, prioritise.
- [ ] **Phase 2 perf** — parallelize sequential Notion queries inside `/api/pcs/*` routes; add in-memory cache per Fluid Compute instance. Defer until the team uses Phase 1 for a workday so we have real hit-rate data to optimize against.
- [ ] **Phase 3 perf (multi-day, deferred)** — Notion → Supabase mirror for `/pcs/*` read paths. Same pattern as Port's Phase A2. Don't start until Phase 2 is exhausted.
- [ ] **`pcs.evidence:attach` audit** — capability scope now gates three write paths (`POST /api/pcs/evidence`, `save-from-search`, `pdf-upload`). One sweep to confirm no path is accidentally open.

## Completed 2026-05-04 (afternoon PT) — RFP Pipeline v2 Phase 1

Architectural upgrade based on the plan + industry research at `~/.claude/plans/generic-popping-bubble.md` (research separately at `~/.claude/plans/generic-popping-bubble-agent-a2328100cdbfe445b.md`). Full debrief in `.brain/memory/engineering/rfp-pipeline-v2.md`.

- [x] **Schema migration** `20260508_rfp_pipeline_v2.sql` — 4 new tables (`rfp_requirements`, `rfp_milestones`, `rfp_assignments`, `collective_cv`) + `rfp_coverage` view + 9 new columns on `rfp_opportunities` (TOR verify, bid decision, EOI/financial URLs)
- [x] **CV seed** from `TEAM_BIOS` (Garrett, Lamis, James/Jamie, Maria, Payton)
- [x] **Pass-2 requirement extractor** (`lib/ai/rfp-requirements-extractor.ts`) — Claude pulls structured deliverables / eligibility / evaluation criteria / admin / submission rows with provenance (extracted_by, confidence, source_quote)
- [x] **rfpDocumentConsumer extended** to write `rfp_requirements` rows after question-bank parse
- [x] **proposal-generator RFP-aware** — accepts `requirements` in context, system prompt emits `deliverables` array driven by approved rows, backward-compat backfill from legacy boolean+string fields
- [x] **proposalConsumer refactored** — single loop over `draft.deliverables` for sub-page creation (variable count), per-contributor `fanOutContributorAssignments()` after generation
- [x] **Verification gate UI** on `/rfp-radar/[id]` — TOR confirm + per-row approve/edit/remove + readiness banner
- [x] **API routes**: `verify-tor`, `requirements`, `requirements/[reqId]`, `bid-decision`, `cv/verify-mine`
- [x] **Bid/No-Bid scorecard** modal in kanban (5 weighted yes/no questions, fires on `reviewing → pursuing` drag)
- [x] **Milestone reminder cron** `/api/cron/milestone-reminders` registered (9/12/15/18 UTC)
- [x] **Per-contributor Slack DMs** in proposalConsumer (sendDmByEmail bot path) with section + CV-verify deep links
- [x] **Both workers deployed** — `wv-port` + `wv-port-jobs`

### Phase 2 (deferred)
- [ ] Answer library + confidence-scored auto-fill (Loopio "Loop Library" pattern)
- [ ] Slack Block Kit interactive buttons (replace deep-link CV verify with native button)
- [ ] Calendar events per milestone (extend existing GCal deadline-event integration)
- [ ] Pre-submission gate UI: block "mark submitted" until coverage view all-green
- [ ] Phase 3: submission tracking + win/loss retrospectives feeding back into prompt library

## Completed 2026-05-04 (morning) — 4-doc RFP generator + 2nd RFP shipped

- [x] **Cost cut: switched proposal-generation from sonnet to haiku-4.5** (~5× cheaper, ~$0.50/proposal vs ~$3). `lib/ai/types.ts` FEATURE_MODELS map.
- [x] **4-document generator deployed** (port-jobs version `686bfbbd`) — `proposal-generator.ts` ProposalDraft now includes `requiresExpressionOfInterest`/`expressionOfInterest` + `requiresFinancialProposal`/`financialProposal`. `port-jobs/src/index.ts` creates 📝 EOI sub-page + 💰 Financial Proposal sub-page when AI flags them. Slack summary surfaces all 5 URLs.
- [x] **Changemakers in Family Planning RFP shipped** (May 12 deadline) — 3 docs all live. URLs in handoff.md.
- [ ] **EOI + Financial Proposal URLs not yet in Supabase** — currently only on Notion + Slack. To track on RFP detail page UI, add `expression_of_interest_url` + `financial_proposal_url` columns to `rfp_opportunities` and extend `setProposalUrls`. Not blocking for the user.
- [ ] **UNICEF Global LTAS** — failed twice (May 8 deadline still 4 days out). Next attempt in flight at 12:48 PT. If fails again: switch UNICEF specifically to sonnet, OR trim its question bank size.

## Completed 2026-05-04 (overnight) — Oxfam Denmark RFP shipped + off Vercel AI Gateway

- [x] **Oxfam Denmark RFP proposal drafted** (8am deadline) — full proposal, cover letter, and team CVs generated to Notion. Links in `.brain/memory/handoff.md`.
- [x] **Vercel AI Gateway dependency killed** — `port/lib/ai/client.ts` now calls `api.anthropic.com` directly with a `sk-ant-api03-*` key (created `wv-port-jobs-cf` via Anthropic Console). No more Vercel AI gateway routing or charges.
- [x] **`port/lib/ai/client.ts` lazy-init Proxy** — same pattern as Notion + Supabase clients. Anthropic key rotations propagate without redeploy.
- [x] **`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (gateway URL) deleted from wv-port-jobs.** Old `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (60-char gateway key) still in env but unused — safe to revoke at vercel.com when convenient.

### Pending in morning
- [ ] **Regenerate 3 remaining RFPs** (UNICEF May 8, Changemakers May 12, Evaluation May 25). They DLQ'd during the architecture flip. See playbook in `.brain/memory/handoff.md`. Note the `regenerate-pursuing` admin route also claims `ready-for-review` rows — needs a one-line filter fix OR temporarily flip Oxfam's `status` field before triggering.
- [ ] **Revoke Vercel AI Gateway key + cancel gateway product** at vercel.com if not already used by other apps. Check creaseworks/vault first — they may have their own AI calls routed through it.
- [ ] **Audit findings from `.brain/memory/engineering/2026-05-04-supabase-mirror-audit.md`** — 6 drift sites need cleanup (campaigns cron, rfpDocumentConsumer, etc.)

## Completed 2026-05-04 — RFP generation root-cause fix (CRITICAL)

- [x] **RFP proposal generation root cause identified + fixed** — Two compounding bugs in `port-jobs/src/index.ts` were silently breaking proposal generation:
  1. The CF Workers migration from Inngest **dropped every `setProposalStep()` and `setProposalStatus()` call** to Supabase. The consumer only wrote status to Notion; the polling UI reads from Supabase. Result: even successful generations stayed at `proposal_status='generating'` in Supabase indefinitely (until the 15-min cron sync), and failed generations stayed there forever (the DLQ also only reset Notion).
  2. `seedProcessEnv()` set `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` but the supabase client reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`. Even if the consumer had tried to write, it would have thrown.
  Fix: imported `setProposalStep` / `setProposalStatus` / `setProposalUrls` / `resetProposalToFailed`; added `advance(step)` and `failWith(reason)` helpers wrapping every checkpoint; fixed env-var seeding; added 6-min `Promise.race` timeout around the Claude `generateProposal` call. DLQ now also resets Supabase. Worker `wv-port-jobs` redeployed: version `92ac362e-b35d-4e3a-b735-8e20824637e4`.
- [x] **Reset 4 stuck RFP statuses** — Oxfam Denmark, UNICEF Global LTAS, Changemakers in Family Planning, Evaluation Consultant — all 4 had `proposal_status='generating'` for 4-5 hours. Reset to `failed` with `proposal_step='reset_by_admin'` so user can retry.
- [x] **Live progress UI on RFP detail page** — `port/app/components/proposal-progress.tsx` extended: `useElapsed` returns `{label, ms}`; red banner triggers when elapsed >10min while still generating; amber banner surfaces `proposal_step` values starting with `failed_at_` (race-window state where Supabase has the failure detail before status flips). Polls every 3s. Step taxonomy: `fetching_rfp` → `gathering_context` → `reading_document` → `matching_citations` → `writing_draft` → `building_documents` → `cover_letter` (optional) → `team_cvs` (optional) → cleared on success; on failure `failed_at_<lastStep>: <error>`.
- [x] **Strategy "create with claude" button** — `app/(dashboard)/strategy/create-with-claude-button.tsx` + `/api/strategy/create-campaign` route. On strategy cards with "no crm match" badge, clicking opens a Claude Sonnet draft → creates a CRM campaign with name, type, audience filter, draft email subject, draft email body, internal notes. Payton reviews + refines.
- [x] **Sync now button + social-stats backfill** — `app/(dashboard)/strategy/sync-now-button.tsx`; pulls broadened to last 90 days (was last 10 posts); added `port` block to `SocialStatsSnapshot` from `email_drafts` table (`getPortCampaignStats()` in `lib/marketing/port-campaign-stats.ts`); strategy sidebar relabeled "media mentions" → "campaign reach". Worker `wv-port` deployed: version `d98056fb-24c4-4613-8c5b-0ee7a4612823`.

### Pending after this session
- [ ] **Set 7 missing social env vars on `wv-port`** to populate non-Bluesky platforms (LinkedIn, Substack, Meta/FB+IG). Bluesky already live (3 followers, 6 engagements). See list in `.brain/memory/handoff.md`.
- [ ] **Investigate empty `email_drafts` table** — 0 rows, 0 sent. Either campaigns haven't actually been sent through the port pipeline, or sends went through a different path (Resend webhook? Notion-driven?). Until this is resolved, "campaign reach" stat stays at 0 even after social env vars are set.

## Completed 2026-05-04 — port marketing + strategy session

- [x] **Email drafts → Supabase migration** — `email_drafts` table with 5 indexes; `lib/supabase/email-drafts.ts` module; `app/api/cron/sync-email-drafts-pilot/route.ts` (every 6h: 1/7/13/19); 6 caller files swapped (campaign-stats-strip, campaign-weekly-summary, analytics, recipients, organizations/[id], view/[id]). Closes the last graceful-degradation gap on the port.
- [x] **Marketing strategy page (`/strategy`)** — server-component dashboard at `port/app/(dashboard)/strategy/page.tsx`. Two-column layout: revenue pipeline table + 90-day timeline + 6 campaign cards + budget on left; q2-q3 targets, team accountability, weekly cadence on right. "strategy" nav added to outreach section in `nav-config.ts`.
- [x] **Strategy data corrections (2026-05-04)** — removed LEGO/Superskills (years-old proposal, not active) and UNICEF (no acceptance received) from pipeline; PRME 2026 contract bumped from $48,285 (first invoice) to $145,000 (full signed contract); contracts-signed sidebar now shows layered bar (received/booked/gap) at 29% of $500k target.
- [x] **Campaign architecture clickable** — each strategic campaign card on `/strategy` now fuzzy-matches against existing CRM campaigns (`getCampaignsFromSupabase` + keyword match). Click opens the matching CRM campaign or a search filter; badge shows `N crm · M active` or `no crm match`.
- [x] **Stretch: content → campaign quick-draft** — `port/app/api/content/[id]/draft-to-campaign/route.ts` POST endpoint creates a campaign from an approved/scheduled content item (campaign type `recurring cadence`, since `social` isn't in the type union). UI button `draft-to-campaign-button.tsx` rendered on each draftable content item.
- [x] **Social-stats sync infrastructure** — `getStats()` added to all 4 social clients (linkedin, substack, meta, bluesky); new `sync-social-stats` cron at hours [3,9,15,21]; `/api/marketing/social-stats` GET route; snapshot stored in Supabase `marketing_state` table (key `social-stats`, conceptual KV mapping `marketing:social-stats`). Strategy page sidebar reads with graceful fallback. Migration `20260507_marketing_state.sql` applied.
- [x] **Memory cleanup** — LEGO/Superskills! and UNICEF removed from `CLAUDE.md`, `.brain/memory/operational.md`, `.brain/memory/financial.md`, `.brain/memory/marketing/strategy-2026-q2q3.md`, `.brain/memory/marketing/weekly-cmo-log.md`. PRME contract value updated to $145k throughout.

### Pending (post-this-session)
- [ ] **Set social env vars on `wv-port`** to populate real engagement data: `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `LINKEDIN_PERSON_URN`, `SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION` (+optional `SUBSTACK_COOKIE`), `META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_PAGE_ID`, `META_IG_USER_ID`, `BLUESKY_HANDLE`. Until set, social-stats snapshot returns nulls and progress bars show "awaiting first sync".
- [ ] **Trigger first social-stats sync** — `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://port.windedvertigo.com/api/cron/sync-social-stats` (or wait until next 03/09/15/21 UTC fire).

## Completed 2026-04-26 — harbour launch-readiness session

- [x] **Phase 0 wrap-up complete** — image-failure counter on harbour cron, sweep guard + restored 5 seeded SKUs (migration 053), doc drift closed.
- [x] **Phase 1 SSO verification** — Pool A (creaseworks/vault/depth-chart/harbour), Pool B (port), Pool C (ops) all verified via Chrome MCP. Three-pool architecture documented at `harbour-apps/docs/security/auth-pool-audit-2026-04-25.md`.
- [x] **Phase 2 + 2.5** — port AUTH_URL verified, /crm 308 verified, creaseworks AUTH_URL fix shipped (silenced env-url-basepath warnings).
- [x] **Phase 3a** — harbour magic-link signin live; joined Pool A SSO as 4th app. Same `userId f0e3ec80-…` across all four. `apps/harbour/lib/auth.ts` uses `createHarbourAuth({ appName: "" })`. 7 secrets on `wv-harbour-harbour` Worker.
- [x] **Phase 3b code + deploy** — Google OAuth on harbour. Reuses existing OAuth client `160968051904-ud88va6odnnjlp76j5dlc4qfd8upq2lp`. Worker version `8f5edc0d-…` live; `/api/auth/providers` lists both google + resend. *Functional click-through verification pending user adding redirect URI to Google Cloud Console.*
- [x] **Phase 4a security audit** — full audit at `harbour-apps/docs/security/launch-audit-2026-04-26.md`. 7 must-fix, 22 should-fix initially.
- [x] **Phase 4b Vercel-side** — vault headers, frame-ancestors on creaseworks/site/ops/port. Closed 7 should-fix items.
- [x] **Phase 4b harbour + depth-chart wrapper** — `@windedvertigo/security` package (`packages/security/`) ships `wrapWithSecurityHeaders` + `HARBOUR_DEFAULT_CSP`. harbour and depth-chart Workers wrapped, all 6 headers emitting. Closed 4 must-fix items + many should-fix.
- [x] **Phase 5a smoke script** — `harbour-apps/scripts/launch-smoke.mjs` covers 40 production targets with 3-retry backoff. 40/40 green at last run.
- [x] **Phase 5b smoke Worker deployed** — `wv-launch-smoke` Worker live, cron `*/30 * * * *`, KV `b67fcfef…`. Reads + writes to `latest` key; emits Slack digest on red when `WV_CLAW_WEBHOOK` secret is set. *Webhook URL pending user.*
- [x] **A2 prep — 16 CF Worker apps configured with security wrapper** — bias-lens, code-weave, deep-deck, emerge-box, liminal-pass, market-mind, mirror-log, orbit-lab, paper-trail, pattern-weave, proof-garden, raft-house, rhythm-lab, scale-shift, tidal-pool, time-prism. Each has `worker.ts`, updated `wrangler.jsonc` main field, tsconfig exclude, package.json dep. Deploy via `harbour-apps/scripts/deploy-cf-wrappers.sh`. Commit `042392e`.
- [x] **B1 — vault static CSP removed from vercel.json** — vault's `proxy.ts` (commit `79db6c3`) had a working nonce-based CSP that was being overridden at the edge by `vercel.json`'s static CSP. Removed the static entry; nonce-CSP becomes sole emitter on next vault deploy. Commit `dcbe3ab`.
- [x] **B4 — CSP nonce investigation doc** — `harbour-apps/docs/security/csp-nonce-investigation.md`. Recommendation: keep `'unsafe-inline'` on CF Workers fleet for launch; validate nonce pattern on vault first, then propagate post-launch.
- [x] **C2 partial — DNS audit** — SPF doesn't include `_spf.resend.com` (Resend emails fail SPF alignment), DMARC has no `rua=` reporting. Findings in `harbour-apps/docs/runbooks/launch-monitoring.md`.
- [x] **C4 — launch monitoring runbook** — `harbour-apps/docs/runbooks/launch-monitoring.md`. Triage trees, monitoring URLs, wrangler tail filters, smoke worker KV inspection, rollback procedures.
- [x] **Forward-roadmap plan written** — `~/.claude/plans/partitioned-painting-pascal.md` Phase A/B/C/D, sequencing, risks, done-when criteria. ONE 30-second user gate (A.1) for the entire pre-launch path.

### Completed (previously pending — done 2026-05-01/02)

- [x] **A.1**: harbour Google OAuth redirect URI confirmed in GCP client (Garrett confirmed 2026-05-01).
- [x] **A2 + A4**: `deploy-cf-wrappers.sh --include-depth-chart` run 2026-05-02 — all 16 apps + depth-chart live with `@windedvertigo/security` wrapper, 6 headers verified.
- [x] **A3**: `WV_CLAW_WEBHOOK` secret set on `wv-launch-smoke` — webhook to `#garrett-code-tasks` on wv-claw Slack app (2026-05-01).

## Completed 2026-04-25 — port infra consolidation session

- [x] **CF DNS zone consolidation** — windedvertigo.com zone activated 2026-04-25T01:43 UTC at garrett CF account (`097c92553b268f8360b74f625f6d980a`); migrated from anotheroption account.
- [x] **Port agent (wv-claw) deployed** — end-to-end tested in Slack DM. App `A0AUA3VQHFH` / bot `U0AUPLEA8RL` / audit DB `f2f48a9998d84cd69598efdc79a44f1e`.
- [x] **windedvertigo.com → Cloudflare Workers** — `wv-site` Worker live via OpenNext; Vercel `windedvertigo-site` project deleted.
- [x] **Harbour → Cloudflare Workers** — `wv-harbour-harbour` Worker live with R2 binding for tile images.
- [x] **Depth-chart on CF Workers** — fully wired with all secrets, direct CF routes (bypasses site router), end-to-end auth verified via shared `.windedvertigo.com` cookie.
- [x] **nordic.windedvertigo.com** — custom domain added on Vercel (project `nordic-sqr-rct`, kept on Vercel for Workflow DevKit + Vercel Blob).
- [x] **Vault image bucket public access restored** — after R2 account migration to garrett account.
- [x] **Vault read-time cover_url refactor** — computes from `cover_r2_key` at read time; future R2 migrations are env-var-only.
- [x] **Creaseworks R2 credentials repaired** — production now uses garrett-account keys.
- [x] **Harbour tile images centralized in R2** — admin sync endpoint at `/harbour/api/admin/sync-tiles`.

## Infrastructure / platform (queued — needs focused session)

Two related infrastructure projects surfaced during the R2 token-rotation incident on 2026-04-23. Both are medium-effort and should be tackled together in a single focused session, not piecemeal.

### Project: Cloudflare account consolidation

**Current state**: Assets split across two Cloudflare accounts.
- `garrett@windedvertigo.com` account: DNS zones, domain registrar ("Gearbox"/Cloudflare Registrar)
- `anotheroption@gmail.com` account (ID: `4f33ee381364bce6959bdea092f046bb`): R2 buckets (`crm-assets`, `creaseworks-evidence`), Workers, AI Gateway, etc.

**Target**: Everything under `garrett@windedvertigo.com`.

**Why it matters**: Split accounts mean two logins, two token sets, two billing surfaces, and ongoing confusion when rotating creds (like today's incident). Consolidation reduces cognitive load and blast radius.

**Plan outline** (needs refinement before execution):
1. Audit assets in both accounts — list every zone, bucket, worker, KV namespace, AI Gateway, etc.
2. Move DNS zones + domain registrations to `garrett@windedvertigo.com` via CF's transfer-between-your-accounts flow (low-risk — zones update propagate over minutes)
3. Recreate R2 buckets in target account (R2 buckets are not transferable; must rclone the data over)
4. Update Vercel env vars: `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_*`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL`
5. Redeploy port + harbour; verify uploads + reads
6. Migrate Workers, KV, D1, AI Gateway bindings — recreate + redeploy
7. Delete old account's assets once verified
8. Rotate/deactivate old API tokens

**Effort**: 60–90 minutes once started; most time is the R2 object sync.

### Project: Rename "CRM" → "port" across infrastructure

**Current state**: Legacy "CRM" naming in places where code/config was renamed but infrastructure wasn't.
- R2 bucket name: `crm-assets` (should be `port-assets`)
- Vercel domain aliases: `wv-crm.vercel.app`, `crm.windedvertigo.com` (alongside `wv-port-*` + `port.windedvertigo.com`)
- Possibly Notion databases or other references

**Target**: Everything reads "port" (matches the in-app brand language).

**Plan outline**:
1. Audit every reference to "crm" / "CRM" across repos, Vercel project, Cloudflare, Notion
2. Bucket rename (recreate + sync, like the consolidation — R2 doesn't support direct rename)
3. Remove stale Vercel aliases (`wv-crm.vercel.app`, `crm.windedvertigo.com`) once nothing points at them
4. Update `R2_BUCKET_NAME` env var + `R2_PUBLIC_URL` if that's re-branded too
5. Redeploy; verify no broken links (especially user-shared URLs that embed the old domain)

**Effort**: 30–60 minutes if bundled with the consolidation work (same bucket-sync action).

### Recommendation

Bundle both into a single session titled "port infra consolidation" — the R2 bucket work only happens once (move to new account AND rename). Do it on a low-traffic evening with port users warned that uploads will be briefly unavailable during the sync cutover.

### After PRs merge — autonomous (Claude Code)

- [ ] **Site CF Workers redeploy** — after PR #25 merges: `cd site && npx opennextjs-cloudflare build && wrangler deploy`
  (PPCS launch countdown tool + systems-thinking redirect need this deploy)
- [x] ~~**Phase A.2: port nested-clone resolution**~~ (2026-05-01) — `port/.git` dissolved; archive ref pushed to `wv-port-archive`; `gh repo archive ghandoff/wv-port` complete.
- [ ] **Vercel project cleanup** — delete ~22 dormant projects after Garrett confirms list (see plan file)
- [x] ~~**Phase G.2.1: port → CF Workers (OpenNext)**~~ (2026-05-01) — `wv-port.windedvertigo.workers.dev` live; middleware.ts naming fix; wrangler.jsonc with queue producer bindings + hourly cron.
- [x] ~~**Phase G.2.2: Inngest functions → CF Queue consumers (port-jobs)**~~ (2026-05-01) — `port-jobs/src/index.ts` implements proposalConsumer, proposalDlqConsumer, timesheetConsumer, rfpDocumentConsumer. `seedProcessEnv()` bridge pattern. Native R2 binding for rfp-document consumer.
- [x] ~~**Phase G.2.3: Inngest send() → CF Queues dual-dispatch (all 6 call sites)**~~ (2026-05-01) — All 6 inngest.send() replaced with `publishJob()` + `getCloudflareContext()` in port API routes. `port/lib/cf-env.ts` augments `CloudflareEnv` global. CF canary confirmed live with all 3 queue producer bindings. commit `14f5a71`.
- [ ] **Phase G.2.4: 7-day parity canary** — started 2026-05-01. Compare `wv-port.windedvertigo.workers.dev` vs Vercel prod. Ends ~2026-05-08. After: G.2.5 DNS cutover.
  - **`wv-port-jobs` deploy (Garrett action needed)**: Run `cd port-jobs && bash deploy.sh` to provision 7 secrets + deploy CF Queue consumer. Script is safe — secrets piped directly into wrangler, never printed to stdout. Queues have 1 message each from G.2.3 testing that will process immediately on deploy.
  - Bugs fixed pre-deploy: R2_PUBLIC_URL was pointing at `creaseworks-evidence` bucket instead of `port-assets` (commit `57267e8`). Now reads from `wrangler.jsonc [vars]` with correct domain `pub-ae6933715be744649a1f2fd99346225a.r2.dev`.
  - G.2.5 cutover runbook: `port/G2.5-CUTOVER.md` (commit `a82b156`)
- [ ] **Phase B: harbour-apps subtree merge** — BLOCKED: 7 open PRs in harbour-apps (gate requires 0). Close stale PRs then re-run Phase 0 check.

### PRs opened this session (2026-05-01 hardening pass)

### Ops / Infrastructure
- [ ] **Verify ops OAuth flow** — Garrett: visit ops.windedvertigo.com incognito → should redirect to /login → SSO → dashboard with sign-out button. **(Gate: PR #32 must be merged + Vercel redeployed first.)**
- [ ] **Neon decommission** — Ancestry Neon project safe to delete after 2026-05-04 (7-day clean window). `DATABASE_URL` in ancestry/.env.local already updated; just delete the Neon project.
- [ ] **wv-nordic JWT rotation** — Supabase dashboard → wv-nordic → API Settings → "Generate new JWT secret". Then re-pull new keys to nordic/.env.local (see plan Thread 2).
- [x] ~~**Ancestry → Supabase migration**~~ (2026-04-27) — 20 tables + data migrated from Neon to wv-port-pilot. postgres.js driver wired. Deployed to wv-ancestry on Vercel.
- [x] ~~**ops team members from Supabase**~~ (2026-04-27) — ops_team_members table live; team panel reads from Supabase with static fallback. Also ops_projects seeded + Supabase fallback for projects panel.
- [x] ~~**Set up Cloudflare KV for ops data**~~ — KV wired: API routes read from KV with static fallback, POST /api/kv for dispatch writes (2026-03-29)
- [x] ~~**Connect wv-ops to GitHub**~~ — Auto-deploy: `ghandoff/windedvertigo` → rootDirectory `ops/` (2026-03-29)
- [x] ~~**Ops dashboard: project tracker**~~ — Notion integration fetches from shared projects DB with static fallback (2026-03-29)
- [x] ~~**Set env vars on Vercel for ops**~~ (2026-03-29) — All 10 env vars set including CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN. Redeployed.
- [ ] **Wire QuickBooks into ops dashboard** — Cowork dispatch task pushes P&L, cash flow, invoices to KV → ops reads from KV (Cowork task)
- [ ] **Wire Gusto into ops dashboard** — Cowork dispatch task pushes payroll, team, contractor data to KV (Cowork task)
- [x] ~~**Shared auth package**~~ (2026-03-29) — Extracted to `packages/auth`. CRM + ops re-export from `@windedvertigo/auth`.
- [x] ~~**Middleware → proxy migration**~~ (2026-05-01) — `ops/proxy.ts` → `ops/middleware.ts`, export renamed to `middleware()`. PR #32. Auth guard was dead before this fix.

## Someday

## Done
- [x] ~~Ops auth fix + design system + API routes~~ (2026-03-28) — Auth was broken because static page bypassed middleware. Converted to server component with auth gate. Added sign-out, user email, dynamic date. Imported shared tokens. Created 6 API routes. Deployed.
