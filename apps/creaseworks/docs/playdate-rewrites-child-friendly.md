# Playdate Rewrites — Child-Friendly Voice

All 20 existing playdates rewritten in child-centered language that a five-year-old can understand. Each field is more verbose, warmer, and uses concrete examples instead of abstract design terminology.

> **Note:** The `notion-update-page` MCP tool was unavailable during this session. These rewrites need to be applied to Notion manually or via a sync script.

## 1. function tag scavenger
**ID:** `196d953e-8f11-4110-aa50-a1a83f621a57`

**headline:** find three things nearby and turn them into something you can play with

**find:** look around you right now — what do you see? find three things that are just sitting there. a cup, a pencil, a sock, a block, a spoon — whatever is nearby! grab them and put them in front of you. these three things are about to become part of something amazing.

**fold:** now here's the fun part: give each thing a JOB. one thing is the "launcher" — it sends something flying. one thing is the "holder" — it keeps something safe. one thing is the "roller" — it moves across the floor. now put all three things together into one invention you can actually play with! how do the three jobs work together?

**unfold:** show your invention to someone without telling them what it does. can they figure out the jobs just by looking at it and trying it? what clues helped them guess? what confused them? the way you arrange things TEACHES people how to use them — that's called design! try swapping the jobs around: what if the cup is the launcher instead of the holder?

**rails sentence:** find three nearby objects, give each one a job, then combine them into something playable

**find again prompt:** keep the same three objects but give them completely different jobs. the cup was a holder — now it's a drum! the pencil was a launcher — now it's a bridge! same stuff, totally new invention.

**slots notes (optional):** any three objects you can find nearby — the more different they are from each other, the more interesting your invention will be

**substitutions notes:** playing alone? make a 10-second video showing someone how to play with your invention, then see if they can figure it out without any extra help!

## 2. invisible stage
**ID:** `a2bb977d-9d74-43d1-9193-07cea370664e`

**headline:** build a tiny stage where the EMPTY parts are the most important

**find:** find a flat surface — a piece of paper, a tray, a cutting board, or even just a section of floor marked off with tape. then gather five small things: buttons, coins, pebbles, small toys, whatever fits in your hand. your surface is the STAGE and your small things are the ACTORS.

**fold:** put your five small things on the stage. but here's the trick: the most important part of your stage isn't WHERE the things are — it's where they AREN'T! the empty space between things tells a story. spread two things far apart — they look lonely. push them close together — they look like friends. leave a big empty space in the middle — it looks like something important is about to happen there. arrange your stage so the empty parts make people feel something.

**unfold:** show your stage to someone. what do they notice first — the objects or the empty spaces? try moving just ONE thing and see how the whole feeling changes. here's what's amazing: movie directors, architects, and artists all think about empty space as much as they think about the stuff they put in it. the space between things is a material too!

**rails sentence:** the stage must be more important than the objects on it — empty space does the storytelling

**find again prompt:** make a new stage with the same objects, but this time add one rule: nothing can touch anything else. or try a stage where everything must be touching. how does the rule change what the stage feels like?

**slots notes (optional):** a flat surface for the stage (paper, tray, board) and 5 small things to arrange. tape lines or borders help mark the edges of your stage.

**substitutions notes:** doing this on a video call? your camera frame IS the stage! arrange objects so someone watching on screen feels something from the empty spaces.

## 3. alphabet as architecture
**ID:** `b0431127-4037-485a-9c3c-903a1474f6f5`

**headline:** use letters like building blocks — don't read them, BUILD with them!

**find:** find some letter tiles (from a board game like Scrabble), magnetic fridge letters, or just write letters on small pieces of paper and cut them out. you also need something to connect them: tape, glue, paper clips, or string. get a pile of at least 15-20 letters.

**fold:** here's the wild rule: you're NOT allowed to spell words! instead, use the letters as SHAPES. stack them, line them up, make patterns. the letter A looks like a tent. the letter O looks like a window. the letter T looks like a road sign. build a structure — a tower, a bridge, a fence, a house — where the shape of each letter matters more than what it says. can someone look at your building and understand what it IS without reading anything?

**unfold:** look at your letter building and think: what made it work? did you line things up neatly (that's called alignment)? did you repeat the same letter over and over (that's called rhythm)? did you put similar shapes close together (that's called grouping)? these are the same tricks that architects use to make real buildings make sense!

**rails sentence:** use letter pieces as pure shapes — don't rely on readable words, let the structure speak for itself

**find again prompt:** using the same letter-building, try to make it DO something different. your fence could become a maze. your tower could become a catapult. keep the same shapes but change what they're FOR.

**slots notes (optional):** letter tiles, magnetic letters, or letters written and cut from paper. any connector: tape, paper clips, string, glue.

**substitutions notes:** no letters? use any small things that have shapes — buttons, pasta shapes, cut-out paper shapes. the idea is the same: build with shape, not with meaning!

---

## 4. function swap, same form
**ID:** `269c8348-03dc-4f05-becf-380a47af8792`

**headline:** keep the same stuff — change what it's FOR

**find:** grab a pile of small things that all look kind of the same — a bunch of buttons, a stack of coins, some LEGO bricks, a handful of pebbles, some bottle caps. you want about 10-15 pieces that are all similar. spread them out in front of you.

**fold:** you're going to play three rounds with the SAME pieces, but each round has a different mission. round 1: make your pieces TELL A STORY — arrange them into a picture or a scene. round 2: scramble them up, then ORGANIZE them — sort them into groups by size, color, or some rule you invent. round 3: scramble again, then make them EXPLAIN something — like how to get from the kitchen to your bedroom, or what you ate today.

**unfold:** you used the exact same pieces all three times, but they DID three completely different things! which round was easiest? which was hardest? did you have to invent new rules for each round? the secret is: ANY material can do almost anything — it depends on the RULES you give it, not what the material actually is.

**rails sentence:** you may not add new materials — you may only change what the same pieces are for

**find again prompt:** play one more round but with a new challenge: this time you can't touch the pieces with your hands! use a spoon, chopsticks, or blow on them to move them. how does THAT change what you can make?

**slots notes (optional):** works great with tiles, tokens, caps, stones, LEGO, buttons, coins — any small things that are mostly similar

**substitutions notes:** only have paper? tear it into small pieces first, then play all three rounds with the torn bits!

---

## 5. form swap, same function
**ID:** `bd1102f7-45b4-4a7d-a97d-ac5a1f228fee`

**headline:** say the same thing in two totally different ways

**find:** grab two different ways to make marks — a crayon AND a paintbrush, or a marker AND a piece of chalk, or a pencil AND your finger dipped in mud. you also need something to draw on. now think of one simple idea: "my house," "a happy day," or "my favorite animal."

**fold:** first, draw your idea with mark-maker number one. take your time — try to really show what you mean. now put that drawing aside and draw the SAME IDEA again with mark-maker number two. same idea, but a completely different tool! the crayon version will look different from the paint version, even though you're trying to say the same thing. that's because each tool has its own personality.

**unfold:** put both versions side by side. what's different? what's the same? did the fat crayon make your lines bolder? did the thin pencil add more detail? each tool CHANGES how your idea comes out, even when you're trying to say the exact same thing. that's true for everything — telling a story with words is different from telling it with pictures, even if it's the same story!

**rails sentence:** hold the idea steady — only the tool is allowed to change

**find again prompt:** try it with mark-maker number three! or go beyond drawing: tell your idea as a song, then tell it by arranging objects on a table. same idea, totally different form. what do you notice?

**slots notes (optional):** at least two different mark-makers (crayons, markers, paint, chalk, pencils, fingers) and a surface to draw on

**substitutions notes:** doing this on a video call? swap between typing, drawing, and arranging objects on camera — same idea, three different ways!

---

## 6. one material, three scales
**ID:** `40a44f7d-17f8-4346-bdf9-dbd20306a42a`

**headline:** make the same thing TINY, then MEDIUM, then GIANT — and watch what changes

**find:** pick one thing you have a LOT of — paper clips, LEGO bricks, popsicle sticks, cotton balls, playing cards, or even just pieces of torn paper. grab as many as you can find. you're going to use the same material to build at three different sizes.

**fold:** round 1 — TINY: you have 60 seconds to make the smallest version you can. maybe it fits on your fingertip! round 2 — TABLE SIZE: now make a version that fills up your whole table or desk. round 3 — ROOM SIZE: go BIG! make a version so large it takes up real space — on the floor, across chairs, up the wall. use the SAME material for all three, just more of it each time.

**unfold:** look at all three versions. the tiny one and the big one are made from the same stuff, but they probably look REALLY different! when things get bigger, new problems show up: gravity pulls harder, things fall over, you need more connections. what worked in the tiny version that didn't work in the big version? that's one of the most important ideas in engineering: size changes EVERYTHING.

**rails sentence:** make three versions with the same material at three different sizes: tiny, table-scale, and room-scale

**find again prompt:** pick your favorite scale and try it again, but this time close your eyes while you build! or try building while explaining out loud what you're doing, without looking. what do your hands know that your eyes don't?

**slots notes (optional):** any material you have lots of — paper clips, blocks, cards, cotton balls, sticks, bottle caps, torn paper

**substitutions notes:** only have one of something? draw or describe the other scales! "if this paper clip house were as big as a room, it would need..."

---

## 7. affordance map
**ID:** `5cff90df-55d8-47c0-b994-b1cad092f2a7`

**headline:** look really closely at one thing and figure out all the ways you could hold, balance, and connect it

**find:** pick ONE object — something interesting to look at and touch. a shoe, a mug, a toy dinosaur, a spatula, a water bottle, anything! also grab a marker or some small stickers. you're going to become a detective who studies this ONE object really carefully.

**fold:** look at your object like you've never seen it before. find and mark these special spots: GRIP POINTS — where can you hold it? mark those with a dot. BALANCE POINTS — where does it balance on your finger or on a table edge? mark those differently. JOIN POINTS — where could you attach something else to it? mark those too. FORBIDDEN POINTS — where should you NOT touch or push? (the sharp part, the breakable part.) mark those with an X. now your object has a MAP of everything it can do!

**unfold:** now try to build or do something using ONLY the spots you marked. can you balance it on its balance point and stack something on a grip point? the map you made shows you what the object WANTS to do. every object has hidden talents — you just have to look closely enough to find them!

**rails sentence:** don't build first — map all the special spots first, THEN build from the map

**find again prompt:** pick a completely different object and make the same kind of map. does this new object have more grip points or fewer? more balance points? compare the two maps — what makes objects different from each other?

**slots notes (optional):** one interesting object plus a way to mark spots on it (stickers, tape flags, or a washable marker)

**substitutions notes:** can't mark on the object? use tiny sticky notes or draw the object on paper and mark the spots on your drawing instead!

---

## 8. connector modes relay
**ID:** `b0deb5ab-405e-4aa0-9bba-148771a9a55a`

**headline:** use the same connector in four completely different ways

**find:** choose ONE connector — that means one thing that can hold other things together. a clothespin, a paper clip, a piece of tape, a twist tie, a rubber band, or a binder clip. then grab about 10 small things to connect: blocks, paper scraps, sticks, cards, whatever you have.

**fold:** you're going to play four rounds, and each round your connector has a different job. round 1 — TRIGGER: make the connector launch, release, or spring something. round 2 — SHARE: make the connector hold two things together so they both work. round 3 — STITCH: use the connector to join a whole line or chain of things. round 4 — REVISE: use the connector to take something apart and put it back a different way. same connector all four rounds!

**unfold:** which round was easiest? which was hardest? here's the cool part: the clothespin didn't change — but what you ASKED it to do changed every round! one connector can do lots of different jobs depending on what you need. that's true for tools in real life too — a fork can stir, poke, lift, and scrape, all without changing shape!

**rails sentence:** four rounds, same connector, different job each round

**find again prompt:** keep the job you liked best (trigger, share, stitch, or revise) but swap in a different connector. does a rubber band do the same job differently than a paper clip?

**slots notes (optional):** one connector (clothespin, clip, tape, twist tie, rubber band) and about 10 small things to connect

**substitutions notes:** no connector? use your creativity: fold paper to make tabs and slots that connect things, or use just gravity and balance to hold things together!

---

## 9. design a rule, not an object
**ID:** `022a00aa-e686-464e-815c-99c8d550e030`

**headline:** instead of building a thing, invent a RULE that changes how things work

**find:** gather a handful of small things — blocks, buttons, toys, whatever — and put them on a table or flat surface. also grab something to write with and write on (paper and marker, or a sticky note).

**fold:** here's your challenge: DON'T build anything! instead, write ONE rule that changes how people can play with the things on the table. examples: "you can only move things by blowing on them." or "everything must be touching at least one other thing." or "you have to close your eyes before you pick something up." write your rule down, then TRY playing with it! see what happens.

**unfold:** did your rule make things easier or harder? more fun or more frustrating? show your rule to someone else and let THEM try. where did the rule work perfectly? where did it break or get confusing? the amazing thing about rules is: you didn't change the objects at all, but the rule made them feel like COMPLETELY different materials! game designers do this all the time — the rules ARE the game.

**rails sentence:** your job is to write a rule that makes the same materials behave in a whole new way

**find again prompt:** rewrite your rule to make it SIMPLER — can someone start playing in less than 30 seconds? the best rules are easy to learn but hard to master.

**slots notes (optional):** small objects for the playing field, plus something to write the rule on (paper, sticky note, cardboard)

**substitutions notes:** nothing to write on? just SAY the rule out loud and test it right away! the rule doesn't have to be written — it just has to be clear enough for someone else to follow.

---

## 10. transfer test (find again)
**ID:** `ed38a101-c954-47c9-8d5a-3805ad03ca45`

**headline:** build the same idea with two totally different materials and see what changes in YOU

**find:** think of something you want to build — a bridge, a container, a tower, a tool. now pick TWO materials that are really different from each other. material A might be paper and tape. material B might be playdough and sticks. or material A is LEGO and material B is fabric and string. you need both sets ready to go.

**fold:** first, build your idea with material A. take your time, make it work. now step back and LOOK at what you built — notice the shapes, the connections, what's strong and what's wobbly. now take a deep breath... and build the SAME idea from scratch with material B. same goal, completely different stuff!

**unfold:** put both versions side by side. they probably look really different even though they're supposed to do the same thing! here's the deep question: did YOU think differently when you used different materials? did the paper make you fold and the playdough make you squish? the material didn't just change what you built — it changed HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKED while building it. that's wild!

**rails sentence:** you must rebuild the same idea using a completely different set of materials

**find again prompt:** keep material B but change your building idea. does material B suggest different things to build than material A did? what does each material WANT to become?

**slots notes (optional):** two different sets of materials from different categories — like paper vs. clay, or blocks vs. string and sticks

**substitutions notes:** only have one kind of material? change the RULES instead of the materials: build it once with two hands, then build it again using only one hand. same stuff, different constraint — your brain will still think differently!

## 11. affordance speed-dating
**ID:** `bdc03480-0a41-40f7-90e2-815fd0eb3934`

**headline:** grab something random, set a timer, and discover what it secretly wants to do

**find:** find one connector-type thing — a clothespin, a binder clip, a piece of tape rolled into a loop, a twist tie, a rubber band. also find a flat surface to work on. that's it — just one connector and a surface. set a timer for 60 seconds.

**fold:** ready? GO! in 60 seconds, make your connector do something it was NOT designed for. a clothespin isn't just for holding clothes — can it be a catapult? a tiny chair? a pair of chomping jaws? a building connector? try as many ideas as you can before the timer runs out. don't stop to make anything perfect — just try, try, try! aim for at least five different ideas.

**unfold:** look at what you tried. which ideas surprised you? was there something the connector WANTED to do that you didn't expect? the cool part is: you discovered something about this object that most people never notice. every object has hidden talents — things it can do that nobody designed it for. finding those hidden talents is what inventors do!

**rails sentence:** work in 60-second rounds — name five possible uses before you pick one to develop

**find again prompt:** swap your connector for a completely different one and try again. keep the same PURPOSE (like "make something that launches") but use the new connector. which connector did the job better?

**slots notes (optional):** any simple connector: clothespins, binder clips, tape, twist ties, rubber bands, paper clips

**substitutions notes:** no connector? use paper folding or tearing as your connector — folds and tears can join, hook, and hold things together!

---

## 12. two-minute kitbash
**ID:** `61eb845e-c347-481a-aa42-e7e57ceb7e72`

**headline:** grab three things, set a timer, and make something you can play with — GO!

**find:** pick three things. any three things! a cup and a rubber band and a piece of paper. or a sock and a spoon and some tape. the weirder the combination, the better. put them in front of you. set a timer for two minutes.

**fold:** ready? START! you have two minutes to make something playable — something you can do something WITH. it doesn't have to be pretty. it doesn't have to be perfect. it just has to DO something. mash things together, tape things on, stuff things inside each other, fold, rip, stack — whatever works! when the timer goes off, STOP. even if it's not done. that's part of the game.

**unfold:** look at what you made. see those creases, folds, and messy connections? those are called TRACES — they show where your hands made decisions. point to one spot that surprised you. maybe you folded something in a way you didn't plan, and it actually worked! or maybe something ripped and made a cool shape. the mistakes and surprises are often the best parts. that's what real designers know: making something FAST teaches you things that thinking slowly never can.

**rails sentence:** you get two minutes and one try — stop when the timer goes off and learn from what happened

**find again prompt:** do it again with the same three things, but swap ONE thing for something different. keep the same play goal. what changed when you changed just one material?

**slots notes (optional):** any three materials — the less "obvious" the combination, the more creative you'll have to be

**substitutions notes:** don't have tape or glue? use paper tearing and folding to connect things — ripped edges can hook together, and folds can make pockets and slots!

---

## 13. the misleading prototype
**ID:** `2432fd7e-ca4b-486e-b9ee-388b5b65a8fe`

**headline:** build something that LOOKS like one thing but is secretly something else

**find:** pick one small object and one connector (tape, string, a clip). you're going to build something tricky — something that makes people THINK it does one thing, but it actually does something different. like a box that looks like it opens on top but really opens from the bottom. or a tower that looks like it's for stacking but is really a marble run!

**fold:** build your sneaky invention. the trick is in the DETAILS — make the outside look normal and expected, but hide the real function somewhere surprising. a "cup" that's actually a spinner. a "bridge" that's actually a launcher. the better it fools people at first glance, the more fun the "a-ha!" moment will be when they discover what it REALLY does.

**unfold:** show it to someone. watch their face! first they'll think they know what it is. then they'll discover the surprise. the moment between "I think I know" and "oh WAIT!" is the best moment in all of design. magicians do this. toy designers do this. even joke-tellers do this — they set up what you EXPECT, then give you something different. what clue finally revealed the real function?

**rails sentence:** your invention must trick people at first glance but be playable once they figure it out

**find again prompt:** think about things in real life that surprised you when you found out what they really do. a bench that's secretly a storage box? a pen that's secretly a flashlight? surprises are everywhere once you look for them!

**slots notes (optional):** one or two objects plus a connector — simple materials make the best misleading prototypes

**substitutions notes:** doing this on a video call? use camera angles to create the trick — make something look huge by holding it close to the camera, then reveal it's actually tiny!

---

## 14. kek loop micro-experience
**ID:** `7e7a457b-6917-4e16-88dc-9acb67a8087a`

**headline:** guess what will happen, make something fast, then see if your guess was right

**find:** K stands for "KNOW" — before you touch anything, say out loud what you THINK you're about to make. "I think I'm going to make a tall tower." or "I think this paper will fold into a bird." say your guess! this is your prediction, and it's okay if it's wrong.

**fold:** E stands for "EXPERIENCE" — now MAKE something, fast! grab paper, blocks, clay, whatever is near you. you have 30 seconds. don't plan — just go! let your hands decide. what comes out might match your guess... or it might be completely different.

**unfold:** K again — "KNOW" — look at what you made. was it what you predicted? probably not exactly! say out loud what ACTUALLY happened: "I said I'd make a tower, but I actually made more of a cave." the gap between what you EXPECTED and what HAPPENED is where all the learning lives. that gap is called a SURPRISE, and surprises are your brain's favorite way to learn.

**rails sentence:** K then E then K — predict, make, and reflect, keeping each step under 30 seconds

**find again prompt:** do it again with a different material. make the same prediction — "I'll make a tall tower" — but with something totally different. does the material change what comes out, even when you're trying to make the same thing?

**slots notes (optional):** any material that's quick to work with — paper is perfect because it's fast to fold, tear, and stack

**substitutions notes:** doing this from far away? say your prediction out loud, make something with whatever's near you, and take a photo as proof of what actually happened!

---

## 15. material dialogue (pair build)
**ID:** `383a2baa-4b5b-488b-86e2-b9e50d2b3b1c`

**headline:** build something together, but one person can only change the SHAPE and the other can only change the PURPOSE

**find:** you need a partner and a shared pile of building materials — blocks, paper, tape, whatever you have. sit so you can both reach the same building area. decide who is the SHAPE person and who is the PURPOSE person.

**fold:** take turns! the SHAPE person can only change what things LOOK like — move them, stack them, rearrange them, fold them. but they're NOT allowed to say what the thing is FOR. the PURPOSE person can only DECLARE what the thing does — "this is a bridge!" "this is a trap!" "this is a chair for a hamster!" — but they're NOT allowed to touch anything. go back and forth: shape person changes something, purpose person declares what it is now.

**unfold:** you probably disagreed sometimes! the shape person moved something and the purpose person said "that's a boat!" and the shape person was thinking "no, it's a roof!" that's the whole point — when one person controls the shape and another controls the meaning, they have to LISTEN to each other. where did you disagree? where did someone surprise you with an idea you loved? that's what teamwork actually feels like.

**rails sentence:** one person can only change shape, the other can only change purpose — take turns and see what emerges

**find again prompt:** switch roles! if you were the shape person, now be the purpose person. does it feel different? do you notice different things?

**slots notes (optional):** works great in pairs or small groups — any shared pile of building materials

**substitutions notes:** doing this from far away? use a shared digital drawing tool, or alternate turns: one person arranges objects on camera, the other person says what it is!

---

## 16. build a connector that teaches
**ID:** `381c07f8-76c7-4e55-9123-d7b4511b35ae`

**headline:** invent a brand-new way to connect two things — then explain what it teaches

**find:** find two things that don't naturally go together — like a paper towel tube and a shoe, or a book and a water bottle. also grab something you could use to connect them: string, tape, rubber bands, twist ties, paper clips, or even just clever folding. your mission: invent a way to make these two things stick together.

**fold:** try connecting your two objects. not just sticking them together — make a connection that DOES something interesting. maybe the string wraps in a way that lets one object swing. maybe the tape creates a hinge so things fold. maybe the clip holds them at a special angle. once your connection works, write ONE sentence explaining what your connector makes possible: "this connector lets the tube swing back and forth" or "this connector makes them fold like a book."

**unfold:** your one sentence is actually a DESIGN LABEL — it tells people what your invention does. is your connector a hinge? a hook? a spring? a cradle? try to give it a name. the connection you invented might not exist anywhere else in the world — you made something NEW! try it with two completely different objects and see if your same connector idea still works.

**rails sentence:** invent a connection, then write one sentence explaining what it makes possible or impossible

**find again prompt:** use the same connector IDEA (like "things that swing" or "things that fold") but with totally different materials. does your connection logic work with new stuff?

**slots notes (optional):** two objects to connect plus a connector material: twist ties, thread, rubber bands, clips, tape, string

**substitutions notes:** no fastener? use folding! cut slots and tabs in paper or cardboard — they lock together without any tape or glue needed.

---

## 17. revision as a first-class material
**ID:** `27cd46be-b2c1-4075-b7b7-ca85302dbaf3`

**headline:** make the same thing TEN TIMES and watch it get better (or weirder!)

**find:** grab a pencil and a stack of paper (at least 10 sheets). or use a whiteboard and marker that you can erase. or clay you can squish and reshape. the key is: you need something you can make, change, and remake FAST.

**fold:** draw or build something in 30 seconds. done? good — that's VERSION 1. now change ONE thing about it. just one! make it bigger, or add a window, or change the color, or remove a part. that's VERSION 2. change one more thing — VERSION 3. keep going! your goal is to reach VERSION 10. each time, only change ONE thing from the version before. don't try to make it "good" — just keep changing.

**unfold:** line up all 10 versions. look at how version 1 and version 10 are different — they might not even look related! which change made it better? which change made it worse? which change surprised you? the secret is: revision isn't about fixing mistakes — it's about DISCOVERING things. every time you change something, you learn something new. professional artists, writers, and inventors make HUNDREDS of versions. version 1 is never the best one!

**rails sentence:** your goal is ten versions with one change each time — not a perfect final product

**find again prompt:** pick something in your life you usually do once and try doing it ten times with small changes. draw your name ten different ways. build a paper airplane ten times, changing one fold each time. what do you discover?

**slots notes (optional):** anything you can quickly make and change: paper and pencil, whiteboard, clay, building blocks, or even arranging the same objects 10 different ways

**substitutions notes:** working on a computer? duplicate your page or canvas 10 times and change one thing each time — same idea, digital version!

## 18. the constraint makes the game
**ID:** `4b8ec50e-1cc3-411a-849b-75d9f8fe2e4c`

**headline:** build something awesome, but you're NOT allowed to use your hands normally!

**find:** gather a handful of small things to build with — blocks, paper, small toys, whatever you have. also pick ONE "tool" — a spoon, a stick, a clothespin, or even just one finger. here's the rule: you can ONLY touch the building materials with your tool. no regular grabbing with your hands!

**fold:** start building something — a tower, a bridge, a little house, anything you want. but remember: you can only use your tool to move, push, balance, and arrange things. the spoon scoops. the stick pokes and pushes. the clothespin grabs (kind of). it's going to be harder than you think! some things that were easy with your hands become really tricky with a tool. but you'll also discover that the tool can do some things BETTER than your hands.

**unfold:** look at what you built. it probably looks different from what you'd normally make — the tool shaped the design! where did the constraint (the "no hands" rule) create something cool that you never would have thought of? where was it just frustrating? that's the big lesson: constraints — rules that limit you — don't just make things harder. they force your brain to think in completely NEW ways. every game you've ever played has constraints, and that's exactly what makes them fun!

**rails sentence:** you may only touch the building materials using one tool or connector — no regular hand-grabbing allowed

**find again prompt:** keep the same building goal but switch to a different constraint: only use your non-dominant hand. or build with your eyes closed. or build while someone else gives you directions. each new rule creates a completely different experience!

**slots notes (optional):** building materials plus one "tool" object to use as your only hand (spoon, stick, clothespin, chopstick)

**substitutions notes:** no tool? use a "single finger" rule — you can only use one finger on each hand. or a "no hands on the table" rule — you have to pick things up in the air!

## 19. trace hunting (unfold the evidence)
**ID:** `d1aa2a56-ab2d-4b8a-b90b-ea29258e9b17`

**headline:** make something fast, then become a detective and find all the clues your hands left behind

**find:** grab something to draw or build with — paper and a pen, or a pile of blocks, or some clay. also grab a different-colored marker or some small stickers for the detective work that comes later. you need a way to MARK things.

**fold:** set a timer for 60 seconds. draw something or build something as fast as you can. don't plan — just go! when the timer stops, STOP. don't fix anything. don't clean it up. leave it exactly as it is, messy parts and all.

**unfold:** now become a detective! look really closely at what you made. find the TRACES — the clues that show what happened while you were making it. circle the spot where you HESITATED (you can tell because the line wobbles or the blocks are crooked). put a star where you SIMPLIFIED (you planned something fancy but made it simple because of time). put an X where you ASSUMED something (you built it one way because that's what you always do). these traces are like footprints — they tell the story of your thinking! every messy mark and crooked stack is a clue about how your brain works.

**rails sentence:** make something fast, then stop and label all the traces of your decisions before improving anything

**find again prompt:** try this with something you already made — a drawing from last week, a LEGO build that's been sitting around. look for traces you left behind without realizing it. what story do they tell?

**slots notes (optional):** any quick-creation materials plus a different-colored marker or stickers for labeling the traces

**substitutions notes:** no markers for labeling? use sticky notes, or just point to traces and say them out loud: "here's where I hesitated, here's where I took a shortcut!"

## 20. do not use as a design teacher
**ID:** `9e488d7d-e589-4578-923e-7fb0c0ec33ea`

**headline:** some materials aren't right for every situation — figuring out WHY teaches you about caring

**find:** think of a material that you shouldn't use in a certain situation. for example: glitter is fun, but it's not great for a baby's toy (they might eat it!). scissors are useful, but not safe for a very young child without help. glass is beautiful, but not good for a ball you throw around. pick one "tricky" material and one SAFE substitute that could do a similar job.

**fold:** design something using ONLY the safe substitute — not the tricky material. your challenge: make it just as cool and fun as the "tricky" version would have been, without using the thing that might cause a problem. if you replaced glitter with shiny stickers, can your project be just as sparkly? if you replaced glass with clear plastic, can it still be beautiful?

**unfold:** what you just did is really important — you CARED about who might use your creation and made it safe for them. that's not a limitation — it's a SKILL. the best designers in the world think about this all the time: who will use this? could anyone get hurt? is this fair for everyone? when you choose materials with other people in mind, that's called DESIGNING WITH CARE. and the safe version is often just as good — sometimes even better!

**rails sentence:** treat "you can't use that" as a puzzle about caring for others, not just a rule to follow

**find again prompt:** look around your house for things designed with safety in mind: rounded corners on tables, soft edges on toys, lids that are hard for little kids to open. someone thought about who would use it and made it safer on purpose. can you find five examples?

**slots notes (optional):** think of one "tricky" material and pick a safe substitute — then build something using only the safe version

**substitutions notes:** can't think of a restricted material? make up a pretend one: "in this game, you're not allowed to use anything RED." now build something without any red things. the rule makes you creative!

## Summary

All 20 playdates have been rewritten with:
- **Longer, more descriptive text** for find, fold, unfold, find again prompt
- **Child-centered language** that a five-year-old can follow
- **Concrete examples** instead of abstract terminology
- **Encouraging, warm tone** throughout
- **More verbose substitutions and slots notes** with specific alternatives

The core intellectual content and design thinking is preserved — it's not dumbed down, just expressed through accessible language and specific, tangible examples.
