# CI — type-check and lint creaseworks on every push and PR.
#
# Runs TypeScript compilation (tsc --noEmit) and the ESLint check.
# Does NOT run `next build` because that requires real env vars
# (database, Stripe, etc.) which aren't available in CI.
#
# Monorepo: runs only when creaseworks files change.
